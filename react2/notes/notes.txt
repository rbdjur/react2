1.  requiring an entire folder must include "index.js" to be the default file. 

cannot require folder entirely unless there is an index.js.
- instead just require the specific file you want inside that folder.
- If doing it this way, must make a "index.js" file and inside the file: 

"

    module.exports = {
        (the variable you want to export)
    }

2. Requiring and naming order
Must: 

"
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

"

require express and define it in a variable before you can use "const app = express();"
- If not an error will appear stating "express();" is not defined. 

3. Deprecated Warning 

mongoose.connect(MONGODB_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true });

The:
"
{ useNewUrlParser: true });

                            "

is the new code to be used because the old code is depcrecated.
